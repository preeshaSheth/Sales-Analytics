# 📊 Sales Analytics Dashboard & Forecasting

**A comprehensive business intelligence solution designed to transform raw sales data into actionable strategic insights.**

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on the full data lifecycle—from data ingestion and cleaning to advanced visualization and predictive modeling. It enables stakeholders to monitor KPIs, track regional performance, and forecast future revenue trends using a robust **Power BI** architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features & Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Integration & ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
* Established connections to raw data sources and utilized **Power Query Editor** for rigorous data cleaning and processing.
* Performed advanced data modeling to ensure accurate relationships between sales, location, and product tables (Star Schema).

### 2. Complex Calculations with DAX
* Engineered **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)** measures to calculate critical financial metrics
* Created custom calculated columns to categorize data for granular analysis.

### 3. Advanced Visualization & UI Design
* Designed an intuitive, visually compelling dashboard layout focused on User Experience (UX).
* Implemented advanced visualization techniques:
    * **Geospatial Maps:** For regional sales distribution and density analysis.
    * **Donut Charts:** For categorical segmentation (Payment Mode, Consumer Segment).
    * **KPI Cards:** For instant visibility of Revenue, Profit, and Avg Delivery Time.

### 4. Interactivity & User Control
* Deployed dynamic **Slicers and Filters** to enable users to drill down into specific data points by Region, State, and Sub-Category.
* Configured cross-filtering interactions between charts to provide a synchronized, context-aware view of the data.

### 5. Predictive Analytics
* Leveraged Power BI’s built-in **forecasting algorithms** to generate a 12-month forward-looking sales prediction.
* Analyzed confidence intervals (95%) to assess future volatility, seasonality, and demand trends.

## 📈 Insights Derived
* **Seasonal Trends:** Identified a significant "Q4 Hockey Stick" effect with massive revenue spikes in Nov/Dec.
* **Operational Risks:** Highlighted a 43% dependency on Cash on Delivery (COD), creating cash flow and return risks.
* **Geographic Gaps:** Pinpointed market under-penetration in the Central US region compared to coastal hubs.
